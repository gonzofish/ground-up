        <h1>My Link Example</h1>

        <p>
            Sometimes we just want to allow a user the ability to visit
            other pages. Links provide us that ability! They're like a
            teleportation system between locations. Click and you're
            sent off to another page at the speed of light!
        </p>

        <p>
            Don't believe me? Just
            <a href="https://github.com/gonzofish/ground-up/blob/master/README.md">click this link</a>
            and see for yourself! You'll be whisked away to the land of
            README!
